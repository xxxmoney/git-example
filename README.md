# Simple guide to GIT

## Concept
- Git is a versioning system - think of stuff like Google Drive 
    - How is stores versions of your files

- Just like Google Drive has your history in versions, Git uses *commits*
    - Think of *commits* as snapshots of your changes

## Getting started
- First of all, we need to initialize git somehow
- Create new directory `mkdir sample-repo`
- We can then navigate in said folder with `cd sample-repo`
- When we initialize git in a folder, we call it *repository*
- This is done by `git init` command
    - This can be done in any directory 
        - When learning, use empty directory
    - Simple, right? This commands creates a hidden *.git* folder
    - This folder stores all the important information about your *repository*
- With this, we have officialy initialised a *repository* in our folder
